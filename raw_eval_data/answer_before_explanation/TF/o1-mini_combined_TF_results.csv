198,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",FALSE,FALSE,"in rom, closing the transistor gate typically represents a logic 0."
199,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,TRUE,TRUE,flash drives offer faster data access speeds compared to traditional secondary memory.
200,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",FALSE,FALSE,"in memory hierarchy, higher speed memories usually have smaller sizes."
201,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,FALSE,FALSE,"direct mapping uses tag fields, not block fields, to check block presence in cache."
