TF,Implicit addressing is also called inherent addressing.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE," Implicit addressing refers to an addressing mode where the operand address is inherent in the instruction itself, not the inherent addressing."
TF,"In direct access file, addition and deletion of records is very complicated.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE," Direct access files allow random record access, simplifying additions and deletions."
TF,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,A key field uniquely identifies a record.
TF,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"  Sequential files have limited random access, making updates difficult."
TF,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,The slave strobes the data at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.
TF,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE, Synchronous buses are usually used for devices with variable speeds.
TF,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE," Asynchronous transmission allows each device to transmit data independently, making it suitable for systems with multiple peripherals."
TF,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE, Synchronous bus modes generally offer faster data transfer due to their deterministic nature.
TF,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE, The bus control scheme is separate from the interface circuits and timing signals are usually generated by a dedicated clock generator.
TF,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE," The ROM stores a value, regardless of the transistor gate state."
TF,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE," Flash drives are a type of secondary storage, not a solution to overcome slow secondary memory speeds."
TF,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,Memory speed and size are inversely related in the memory hierarchy; faster memory tends to be smaller and more expensive.
TF,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,  Block field is not used for direct memory mapping.
