TF,"In direct access file, addition and deletion of records is very complicated.",,,,,FALSE,TRUE,Records are stored at specific locations; adding or deleting requires reorganization.
TF,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,A key field uniquely identifies a record within a dataset.
TF,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Updation in sequential files requires rewriting the entire file or a significant portion of it.
TF,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"In synchronous buses, the master controls the timing, strobing the slave at the end of each clock cycle."
TF,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Asynchronous buses handle variable speed devices efficiently, making it suitable for such connections."
TF,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Asynchronous transmission handles multiple devices efficiently by independent data transfer.
TF,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,,,,,FALSE,TRUE,"Asynchronous BUS utilizes handshaking, enabling efficient data transfer at varying speeds."
TF,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Interface circuits provide the necessary timing signals for bus control.
TF,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"A closed gate prevents current flow, resulting in a 0, not a 1, in ROM."
TF,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Flash drives are faster than traditional secondary storage like hard disk drives.
TF,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"Faster memory (cache) is smaller; slower memory (RAM, disk) is larger."
TF,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,,,,,FALSE,TRUE,"In direct mapping, a block's presence is checked using the block field to determine its location in memory."
