TF,The hard disk can be transferred from one place to another.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Hard disks are physical components and can be moved between locations or computers.,,
TF,The capacity of a floppy disk is 1.44MB.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Floppy disks commonly had a capacity of 1.44MB.,,
TF,Ripple is a two-bit asynchronous binary counter.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,Ripple counters are usually implemented with flip-flops and can count more than two bits.,,
TF,Implicit addressing is also called inherent addressing.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Implicit addressing is indeed also known as inherent addressing mode.,,
TF,"In direct access file, addition and deletion of records is very complicated.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"Direct access files allow random access, making record addition/deletion less complicated than sequential files.",,
TF,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Key fields uniquely identify records," distinguishing them from others in a database.""""",
TF,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Sequential files must be read in order, making direct updates difficult.",,
TF,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,The master does not strobe the slave in synchronous bus. It happens in asynchronous bus.,,
TF,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,Variable speed devices may use synchronous or asynchronous communication depending on the application.,,
TF,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,"Asynchronous transmission requires start/stop bits for each byte, adding overhead, which makes it less efficient for multiple devices.",,
TF,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"Asynchronous communication relies on control signals and handshaking protocols, which adds overhead and slows down data transfer.",,
TF,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Interface circuits synchronize data transfer with the bus using appropriate timing signals.,,
TF,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"The transistor gate being closed does not guarantee a value of 1 in ROM.""",,
TF,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,"Flash drives are secondary memory, so flash drives would not be used to overcome slow secondary memory.",,
TF,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"As speed increases, memory size usually decreases (registers, cache, main memory, disk, etc.).",,
TF,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"In direct mapping, the tag field, not the block field, is used to check the memory block's presence.",,
