185,BASIC is a programming language.,TRUE,TRUE,basic is a high-level programming language designed for ease of use.
186,The hard disk can be transferred from one place to another.,TRUE,FALSE,hard disks are generally fixed inside computers and are not designed for frequent physical transfer.
187,The capacity of a floppy disk is 1.44MB.,TRUE,TRUE,a standard 3.5-inch floppy disk holds 1.44mb of data.
188,Ripple is a two-bit asynchronous binary counter.,TRUE,FALSE,ripple counters can be designed with various bit widths; they are not limited to two-bit configurations.
189,Implicit addressing is also called inherent addressing.,TRUE,TRUE,"implicit addressing, also known as inherent addressing, uses the operand provided by the opcode."
190,"In direct access file, addition and deletion of records is very complicated.",FALSE,TRUE,managing addition and deletion in direct access files is complex due to record reorganization.
191,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,TRUE,TRUE,a key field uniquely identifies records within a file or database.
192,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",TRUE,TRUE,updating sequential files is difficult because records must be processed in order.
193,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,TRUE,FALSE,"in synchronous buses, data latching is controlled by clock edges, not by a master strobe at cycle’s end."
194,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,TRUE,TRUE,asynchronous buses use handshaking to accommodate devices running at different speeds.
195,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,TRUE,TRUE,asynchronous transmission is well suited for systems with multiple peripherals having varying speeds.
196,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,FALSE,FALSE,"asynchronous bus mode is generally slower due to start, stop, and handshaking overhead."
197,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,TRUE,TRUE,interface circuits generate the timing signals needed to control bus operations.
198,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",FALSE,FALSE,"in rom cells, a conducting (closed) transistor generally represents 0, not 1."
199,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,TRUE,TRUE,faster flash drives are used to improve performance compared to slower traditional secondary memory.
200,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",FALSE,FALSE,"in the memory hierarchy, faster memories (like registers and cache) are much smaller in size."
201,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,FALSE,FALSE,"direct mapping uses the tag field, not the block field alone, to verify a block’s presence."
