TF,Ripple is a two-bit asynchronous binary counter.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,Ripple counters can have more than two bits and are asynchronous.
TF,Implicit addressing is also called inherent addressing.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Implicit and inherent addressing both refer to instructions where the operand is implicitly defined by the opcode.
TF,"In direct access file, addition and deletion of records is very complicated.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"While updates require rewriting the file, additions/deletions can be handled by marking space as unused."
TF,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"A key field's uniqueness distinguishes each record, ensuring proper identification within the dataset."
TF,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Sequential file updation involves rewriting, making it difficult to update specific records."
TF,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,"In synchronous bus communication, the master and slave are synchronized by a common clock signal, not at the end of each cycle."
TF,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,Variable speed devices use synchronous buses for coordinated data transfer.
TF,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,"Asynchronous mode can be used, but not specifically required for multiple peripheral devices."
TF,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,Asynchronous transmission is generally slower due to the overhead of start and stop bits.
TF,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Interface circuits indeed handle timing signals for bus control.
TF,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"A closed transistor gate typically represents a 0, not a 1, in ROM storage."
TF,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Flash drives are faster than older secondary memory like hard drives, aiding in speed improvements."
TF,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"Speed and size have an inverse relationship in the memory hierarchy: faster = smaller, slower = larger."
TF,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,,,,,FALSE,TRUE,Direct mapping uses a tag field to identify if a block in memory is the one requested.
