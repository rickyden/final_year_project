189,Implicit addressing is also called inherent addressing.,TRUE,TRUE,"Implicit addressing is another term for inherent addressing, where operands are predefined by the instruction itself."
190,"In direct access file, addition and deletion of records is very complicated.",FALSE,TRUE,Adding and deleting records in direct access files is more complex than in sequential access files.
191,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,TRUE,TRUE,A key field uniquely identifies records in a database or file.
192,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",TRUE,TRUE,"Updating a sequential file requires rewriting the entire file, making it inefficient."
193,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,TRUE,TRUE,"In a synchronous bus, the master controls and synchronizes communication with the slave."
194,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,TRUE,TRUE,"Asynchronous buses support devices with variable speeds, allowing independent data transfers."
195,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,TRUE,TRUE,Asynchronous transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices due to its flexible timing.
196,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,FALSE,FALSE,Asynchronous transmission is generally slower than synchronous transmission due to additional start-stop bits.
197,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,TRUE,TRUE,Interface circuits handle timing signals necessary for bus communication.
198,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",FALSE,TRUE,"In ROM, a closed transistor gate represents a stored value of 1."
199,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,TRUE,TRUE,Flash drives provide faster access times than traditional secondary storage such as hard disks.
200,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",FALSE,FALSE,"In the memory hierarchy, as speed increases, memory size generally decreases due to cost and technological limitations."
