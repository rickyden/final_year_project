MC,In 32 bit representation the scale factor as a range of ________,-128 to 127,-256 to 255,0 to 255,None of the mentioned,1,1,"In a 32 bit representation, the scale factor is an 8 bit signed integer ranging from -128 to 127."
MC,"In double precision format, the size of the mantissa is ______",32 bit,52 bit,64 bit,72 bit,2,2,"In double precision, the mantissa is 52 bits long, providing around 15-17 decimal digits of precision."
MC,"Consider an instruction pipeline with five stages without any branch prediction: Fetch Instruction (FI), Decode Instruction (DI), Fetch Operand (FO), Execute Instruction (EI) and Write Operand (WO). The stage delays for FI, DI, FO, EI and WO are 5 ns, 7 ns, 10 ns, 8 ns and 6 ns, respectively. There are intermediate storage buffers after each stage and the delay of each buffer is 1 ns. A program consisting of 12 instructions I1, I2, I3, K, I12 is executed in this pipelined processor. Instruction I4 is the only branch instruction and its branch target is I9. If the branch is taken during the execution of this program, the time (in ns) needed to complete the program is",132,165,176,328,2,3,The pipeline stalls after I4. Instructions I5-I8 are flushed. I9-I12 execute. Total time is (4 * (5+7+10+8+6+4))+ (4*(5+7+10+8+6+4))=176ns.
MC,A RAM chip has a capacity of 1024 words of 8 bits each (1K * 8). The number of 2 * 4 decoders with enable line needed to construct a 16K * 16 RAM from 1K * 8 RAM is,4,5,6,7,2,2,"We need 4 decoders for the address lines and 1 decoder for the data lines, totaling 5 decoders."
