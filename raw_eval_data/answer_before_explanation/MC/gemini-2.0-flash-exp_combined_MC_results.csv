MC,In 32 bit representation the scale factor as a range of ________,-128 to 127,-256 to 255,0 to 255,None of the mentioned,1,1,"Scale factor is represented using 8 bits in two's complement, hence the range is -128 to 127."
MC,"In double precision format, the size of the mantissa is ______",32 bit,52 bit,64 bit,72 bit,2,2,"Double precision uses 64 bits, with 52 bits allocated to the mantissa for representing the significant digits."
MC,"Consider an instruction pipeline with five stages without any branch prediction: Fetch Instruction (FI), Decode Instruction (DI), Fetch Operand (FO), Execute Instruction (EI) and Write Operand (WO). The stage delays for FI, DI, FO, EI and WO are 5 ns, 7 ns, 10 ns, 8 ns and 6 ns, respectively. There are intermediate storage buffers after each stage and the delay of each buffer is 1 ns. A program consisting of 12 instructions I1, I2, I3, K, I12 is executed in this pipelined processor. Instruction I4 is the only branch instruction and its branch target is I9. If the branch is taken during the execution of this program, the time (in ns) needed to complete the program is",132,165,176,328,2,2,"The pipeline stall due to the branch instruction adds delay, resulting in a total execution time of 165ns."
