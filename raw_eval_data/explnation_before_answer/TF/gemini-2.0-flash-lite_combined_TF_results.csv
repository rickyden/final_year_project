TF,The flag register carry indicates whether the result contains an odd number or even number.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,The flag register carry indicates whether the result contains an odd number or even number.
TF,"In flip-flop, the High is also called reset.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"In a flip-flop, reset usually sets the output to low, not high"
TF,Keyboard is an input device.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,The keyboard allows the user to input data into a computer.
TF,BASIC is a programming language.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,BASIC is a programming language. It stands for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.
TF,The hard disk can be transferred from one place to another.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,A hard disk is a physical device that can be moved.
TF,The capacity of a floppy disk is 1.44MB.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,The statement is factually correct about the storage capacity of a standard floppy disk.
TF,Ripple is a two-bit asynchronous binary counter.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,"Ripple counters can have multiple bits and are not necessarily two-bit, making the statement false."
TF,Implicit addressing is also called inherent addressing.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Implicit addressing and inherent addressing are the same thing.
TF,"In direct access file, addition and deletion of records is very complicated.",,,,,FALSE,TRUE,"In direct access files, adding and removing records can be complex due to potential data reorganization."
TF,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,A key field uniquely identifies a record.
TF,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Sequential files require rewriting the entire file to update data.
TF,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS, therefore data transfer happens at the clock's edge."
TF,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,Asynchronous buses are not typically used for devices with variable speeds; synchronous buses are more common.
TF,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Asynchronous transmission suits systems with varied data rates and independent devices, allowing flexible communication."
TF,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,Asynchronous bus modes can be slower due to handshaking overhead.
TF,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Interface circuits provide timing signals for bus control.
TF,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"The statement describes a relationship between a closed transistor gate and ROM value, but it's not universally true."
TF,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Flash drives are faster than secondary memory, but they are not the only solution."
TF,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,Faster memory is smaller and more expensive; slower memory is larger and cheaper.
TF,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"In direct mapping, the presence of a block is checked using the tag field, not the block field"
