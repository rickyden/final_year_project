TF,BASIC is a programming language.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"BASIC is an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages."
TF,The hard disk can be transferred from one place to another.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Hard disks are physical devices that can be moved;
TF,The capacity of a floppy disk is 1.44MB.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,A standard 3.5-inch floppy disk has a capacity of 1.44 MB.
TF,Ripple is a two-bit asynchronous binary counter.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,"A ripple counter uses a series of flip-flops, with the output of one clocking the next."
TF,Implicit addressing is also called inherent addressing.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Implicit addressing and inherent addressing are the same thing.
TF,"In direct access file, addition and deletion of records is very complicated.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"Direct access files allow random access, making addition and deletion less complicated than sequential files."
TF,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"A key field uniquely identifies a record; thus, it must be unique."
TF,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Sequential files require rewriting for updates, making it difficult."
TF,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,"The master controls the slave, but not necessarily at the end of each clock cycle."
TF,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Asynchronous buses handle variable data rates; therefore, devices with variable speeds are typically connected using asynchronous buses."
TF,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Asynchronous transmission handles devices independently, making it suitable for multiple peripherals."
TF,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,Asynchronous BUS uses interrupts and is slower than synchronous;
TF,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Interface circuits are crucial for generating the necessary timing signals in a BUS control scheme.
TF,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"A closed transistor gate prevents current flow, meaning no charge is stored, representing a 0, not a 1."
TF,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Flash drives are faster than traditional hard disk drives, thus improving speeds."
TF,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,Faster memory is typically smaller; slower memory is larger.
TF,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,,,,,FALSE,TRUE,Direct mapping uses a block field to check block presence in memory.
