TF,Merge sort can be implemented using O(1) auxiliary space.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,"Merge sort requires O(n) auxiliary space for merging, thus it cannot be implemented using O(1) auxiliary space."
TF,Merge sort is preferred for arrays over linked lists.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"Merge sort, an algorithm for sorting, works best with arrays due to their random access capabilities, making element retrieval fast.  Linked lists lack random access, requiring traversal, thus making merge sort less efficient."

TF,A greedy algorithm can be used to solve all the dynamic programming problems.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"A greedy algorithm is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution for all dynamic programming problems, thus it cannot be used to solve all of them."
TF,The schema for the relationship set linking a weak entity set to its corresponding strong entity set is redundant.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,The schema for the relationship set linking a weak entity set to its corresponding strong entity set is not redundant because it clarifies the dependency of the weak entity on the strong entity.

TF,Hashing is the problem of finding an appropriate mapping of keys into addresses,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Hashing is a technique used to map keys to addresses.
TF, good hash approach is to derive the hash value that is expected to be dependent of any patterns that might exist in the data,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,A good hash function should ideally produce a value that does not depend on any patterns within the data itself. This would prevent collisions and ensure uniform distribution.
TF,Collisions can be reduced by choosing a hash function randomly in a way that is independent of the keys that are actually to be stored,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,Collisions can be reduced by using a good hash function that distributes keys evenly. Randomly choosing a hash function independent of the keys is generally not a good practice because the hash function needs to be consistent for retrieval.
TF,State true or false: If I = read(Q) and J = write(Q) then the order of I and J does not matter.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"The order of I and J depends on the specific implementation of read and write operations on the queue Q.

TF,The largest value in a binary search tree is always stored at the rightmost node of the tree,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"The largest value in a binary search tree is always stored at the rightmost node of the tree.  This is because, in a binary search tree, every node's left subtree contains values less than the node's value, and every node's right subtree contains values greater than the node's value.  Following this principle down to the rightmost node ensures it holds the largest value."

Assume that we have n numbers to be sorted. The time complexity for sorting these numbers using the insertion sort algorithm is O(n^2).",,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Insertion sort on a linked list still has O(n^2) time complexity, as finding the correct position for each element in the sorted sub-list takes O(n) time in the worst case, repeated n times."
TF,The time complexity of adding 5 to each element of an array of N numbers is O(N).,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"The time complexity of adding 5 to each element of an array of N numbers is O(N) because it involves iterating through each element of the array once. This iteration takes linear time, resulting in O(N) time complexity."
TF,"Let us suppose that there is a variable declaration int x = 50, *ptr. Then, the statement *ptr = &x is a valid statement in main() function.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"Question: Let us suppose that there is a variable declaration int x = 50, *ptr. Then, the statement *ptr = &x is a valid statement in main() function. [The statement *ptr = &x is invalid because it tries to assign the memory address of x to the value pointed to by ptr, which is incorrect.  A pointer variable should be assigned a memory address. The correct way to assign the address of x to ptr is ptr = &x.]"
TF,Minimum and maximum height of a binary heap with N keys will be ? log?N ?.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Question: Minimum and maximum height of a binary heap with N keys will be ? log?N ?.
