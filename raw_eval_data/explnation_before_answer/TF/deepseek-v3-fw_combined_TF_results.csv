191,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,TRUE,TRUE,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another. Key fields uniquely identify records.
192,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",TRUE,TRUE,"In sequential file, updation is not easy. Sequential files are difficult to update."
193,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,TRUE,TRUE,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS. Synchronous BUS uses clock signals for timing.
194,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,TRUE,TRUE,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS. Asynchronous BUS handles variable speed devices.
195,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,TRUE,TRUE,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices. Asynchronous mode supports multiple devices.
196,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,FALSE,FALSE,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer. Asynchronous BUS is slower than synchronous.
197,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,TRUE,TRUE,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme. Interface circuits manage BUS timing.
198,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",FALSE,FALSE,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1. Closed gate stores 0, open gate stores 1."
199,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,TRUE,TRUE,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives. Flash drives are faster than traditional secondary memory.
200,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",FALSE,FALSE,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases. Speed increases, but size decreases."
201,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,FALSE,FALSE,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field. Direct mapping uses index and tag fields.
