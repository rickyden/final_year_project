183,"In flip-flop, the High is also called reset.",FALSE,FALSE,"In flip-flops, the term reset does not refer to the high state; it generally initializes the circuit, so the statement is incorrect."
184,Keyboard is an input device.,TRUE,TRUE,A keyboard is an input device used to enter data into a computer.
185,BASIC is a programming language.,TRUE,TRUE,BASIC is indeed a programming language developed for ease of use.
186,The hard disk can be transferred from one place to another.,TRUE,TRUE,"Hard disks, whether internal or external, can be physically moved from one location to another."
187,The capacity of a floppy disk is 1.44MB.,TRUE,TRUE,A standard floppy disk has a storage capacity of 1.44MB.
188,Ripple is a two-bit asynchronous binary counter.,TRUE,FALSE,"A ripple counter is an asynchronous counter that can have more than two bits; thus, calling it two-bit is too restrictive."
189,Implicit addressing is also called inherent addressing.,TRUE,TRUE,"Implicit addressing, where the operand is inherent in the instruction, is also called inherent addressing."
190,"In direct access file, addition and deletion of records is very complicated.",FALSE,TRUE,"Direct access files use fixed record locations, making additions and deletions more complex."
191,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,TRUE,TRUE,A key field uniquely identifies a record within a file.
192,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",TRUE,TRUE,Updating records in a sequential file is not straightforward and requires extensive processing.
193,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,TRUE,TRUE,"In a synchronous bus, the master provides the strobe or clock signal to control slave timing, ensuring proper data transfer."
194,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,TRUE,TRUE,Asynchronous buses connect devices running at variable speeds without relying on a common clock.
195,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,TRUE,TRUE,Asynchronous transmission uses start and stop bits and is well suited for systems with multiple peripherals.
196,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,FALSE,FALSE,Asynchronous bus transmission is slower due to its overhead compared to faster synchronous methods.
197,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,TRUE,TRUE,Interface circuits generate the necessary timing signals for bus control schemes in system communication.
198,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",FALSE,FALSE,A closed transistor gate prevents conduction and does not signify a stored value of 1 in ROM designs.
199,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,TRUE,TRUE,Faster flash drives are used to mitigate the slower speeds of secondary memory systems.
200,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",FALSE,FALSE,"In the memory hierarchy, faster memories are smaller in size, so size does not increase with speed."
201,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,FALSE,FALSE,"In direct mapping, block presence is verified by comparing tag fields, not a so-called block field."
