188,Ripple is a two-bit asynchronous binary counter.,TRUE,FALSE,A ripple counter typically has more than two bits and propagates carries sequentially.
189,Implicit addressing is also called inherent addressing.,TRUE,TRUE,"Implicit addressing is synonymous with inherent addressing, where operands are implied by the instruction."
190,"In direct access file, addition and deletion of records is very complicated.",FALSE,FALSE,Direct access files allow easy addition and deletion of records without reorganizing the entire file.
191,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,TRUE,TRUE,"A key field uniquely identifies records, allowing differentiation between similar records."
192,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",TRUE,TRUE,"Sequential files require rewriting the entire file for updates, making updates difficult."
193,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,TRUE,FALSE,"In synchronous bus communication, timing is controlled by clock signals, not end-of-cycle strobes."
194,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,TRUE,TRUE,Devices with variable speeds typically use asynchronous bus connections for flexibility.
195,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,TRUE,TRUE,Asynchronous transmission suits systems with multiple peripherals operating at different speeds.
196,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,FALSE,FALSE,Asynchronous transmission is typically slower than synchronous due to overhead from start/stop bits.
197,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,TRUE,TRUE,Interface circuits generate timing signals and handle protocol requirements for bus control.
198,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",FALSE,FALSE,"In ROM, a closed transistor typically stores 0, not 1. Open transistors allow current flow representing 1."
199,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,TRUE,FALSE,"Cache memory, not flash drives, primarily addresses the speed gap between CPU and secondary storage."
200,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",FALSE,FALSE,"In memory hierarchy, as speed increases, size typically decreases due to cost constraints."
201,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,FALSE,FALSE,"In direct mapping, the tag field (not block field) is used to check if the correct block is in cache."
