TF,The flag register carry indicates whether the result contains an odd number or even number.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"The carry flag indicates if an operation resulted in a carry or borrow, not parity."
TF,"In flip-flop, the High is also called reset.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,Flip-flops use 'set' and 'reset' for states; 'High' doesn't directly equate to 'reset'.
TF,Keyboard is an input device.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Explanation: A keyboard sends data to a computer.
TF,BASIC is a programming language.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,BASIC is a well-known high-level programming language.
TF,The hard disk can be transferred from one place to another.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"The question asks if a hard disk can be moved from one place to another, and this is generally true."
TF,The capacity of a floppy disk is 1.44MB.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,The standard high-density 3.5-inch floppy disk has a capacity of 1.44MB.
TF,Ripple is a two-bit asynchronous binary counter.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,Ripple counters don't have to be binary.
TF,Implicit addressing is also called inherent addressing.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Implicit addressing, where the operand is implied, is indeed also known as inherent addressing."
TF,"In direct access file, addition and deletion of records is very complicated.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"Direct access files allow random access, making additions and deletions simpler."
TF,A key field is a unique field in a record used to identify one record from another.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,The explanation is that a key field uniquely identifies a record.
TF,"In sequential file, updation is not easy.",,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Sequential files are accessed record by record, making updates difficult."
TF,The Master strobes the slave at the end of each clock cycle in Synchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,The master doesn't strobe the slave at the end of each clock cycle.
TF,The devices with variable speeds are usually connected using asynchronous BUS.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,Explanation: Asynchronous buses are suitable for devices with variable speeds because they don't rely on a fixed clock signal.
TF,Asynchronous mode of transmission is suitable for systems with multiple peripheral devices.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,"Asynchronous transmission allows devices to communicate without a shared clock signal, making it suitable for multiple peripheral devices."
TF,The asynchronous BUS mode of transmission allows for a faster mode of data transfer.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,Explanation: Asynchronous BUS mode doesn't inherently guarantee faster data transfer.
TF,The Interface circuits generate the appropriate timing signals required by the BUS control scheme.,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,The interface circuits are responsible for generating the necessary timing signals.
TF,"If the transistor gate is closed, then the ROM stores a value of 1.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,The state of a transistor gate does not directly determine the value stored in ROM.
TF,To overcome the slow operating speeds of the secondary memory we make use of faster flash drives.,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,"Secondary memory is slower and flash drives are faster but used for storage, not primary operation."
TF,"In the memory hierarchy, as the speed of operation increases the memory size also increases.",,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"Explanation: Faster memory is more expensive, thus smaller."
TF,In direct mapping the presence of the block in memory is checked with the help of block field.,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,"In direct mapping, the presence of a block is determined by comparing the tag field."
