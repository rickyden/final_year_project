600,"Consider an instruction pipeline with five stages without any branch prediction: Fetch Instruction (FI), Decode Instruction (DI), Fetch Operand (FO), Execute Instruction (EI) and Write Operand (WO). The stage delays for FI, DI, FO, EI and WO are 5 ns, 7 ns, 10 ns, 8 ns and 6 ns, respectively. There are intermediate storage buffers after each stage and the delay of each buffer is 1 ns. A program consisting of 12 instructions I1, I2, I3, �K, I12 is executed in this pipelined processor. Instruction I4 is the only branch instruction and its branch target is I9. If the branch is taken during the execution of this program, the time (in ns) needed to complete the program is",132,165,176,328,2,3,"With pipeline stall at I4 and restart at I9, execution takes 5+7+10+8+6+(11×10)=176ns."
601,A RAM chip has a capacity of 1024 words of 8 bits each (1K * 8). The number of 2 * 4 decoders with enable line needed to construct a 16K * 16 RAM from 1K * 8 RAM is,4,5,6,7,2,1,Need 4 decoders for 16 chips (4 rows × 4 columns) to create 16K×16 RAM from 1K×8 chips.
