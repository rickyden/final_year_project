Therefore, the total time needed is the sum of stall time and normal execution time. Time = (3 * 17 + 12 * 11) = 176,"
MC,A RAM chip has a capacity of 1024 words of 8 bits each (1K * 8). The number of 2 * 4 decoders with enable line needed to construct a 16K * 16 RAM from 1K * 8 RAM is,4,5,6,7,2,1,"We need to select 16 rows out of 1K rows. 16K/1K=16. log base 2 of 16 is 4, so we need 4 * 2x4 decoders with enable."
